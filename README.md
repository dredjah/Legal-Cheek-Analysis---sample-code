# Legal-Cheek-Analysis---sample-code
Python scripts to quality control, analyse and then visualise >1500 questionnaire responses

Over 1500 junior lawyer, from 54 law firms,  took part in the Legal Cheek Junior Lawyer Survey, answering a number of questions about how satisfied they were with various aspects of their job. Included is a sample of the code for one question and the raw files from 3 law firms that were used for analysis. The real analysis used 54 raw files (one from each firm). To get the code to work, 'While Loops' must be modified to be 'less than 4' rather than 'less than 55'.
