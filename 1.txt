Please provide details of exceptional perks your law firm
offers:
Flat rental deposit loan - I was loaned 550 interest free when I had to move quickly and had no time to save up for a
deposit
Q8: How functional, comfortable and impressive is your workplace?
(no label) 9
Furthercomments:
Of the offices I've been to, mine (Leeds) is the second worst. And they're moving from the worst soon. But its not bad
at all. Very clean, just a bit tired and could do with a makeover. Fantastic location though. And the Manchester and
London offices are amazing all round.
Q9: How good is the coffee?
Further comments:
I dont drink coffee but the tea is either Twinnings or Clipper and that is beyond anything Clooney has to offer

Q1: How would you rate the quality of your training?

Further comments:
Generally very good, although somewhat supervisor dependent. Some teams were much better at giving
responsibility than others.
Q2: How stimulating is the work you are given?
(no label) 9
Further comments:
Again, very supervisor dependent. We all accept that as part of the training contract there will be some necessary
administrative evils. I just didn't anticipate my month standing at the printer because my first seat supervisor didn't
trust either the print room or her PA enough to print her documents.

Q5: How is your work/life balance?

Further comments:
Generally a good balance, although in my experience where there is a heavy workload it's because it hasn't been
shared out equally.
Q6: Have you done an international secondment or
travelled abroad with the firm?
No
Q7: How good are yourlaw firm'sperks?

Q1: How would you rate the quality of your training?
(no label) 8
Further comments:
Training will vary depending on who your supervisor is in each department. We get much more TCPD than peers at
other firms, which is definitely a positive.
Q2: How stimulating is the work you are given?
(no label) 9
Further comments:
Work varies depending on the needs of the team at any given time, but I have always found that senior lawyers make
a big effort to get you involved and push you out of your comfort zone. Very happy with the work that I receive and
the responsibility that it entails.
Q3: How supportive are your peers?
(no label) 9
Q4: How approachable are your superiors?
(no label) 8
Further comments:
One of the best aspects of the firm. Everyone, regardless of seniority, has plenty of time for the trainees and make a
big effort to help you develop.
Q5: How is your work/life balance?

Further comments:
You work hard when required but in all of my departments so far it has never been excessive.

(no label) 8
Please provide details of exceptional perks your law firm
offers:
Wellness week free massages, healthcare, subsidised food in the canteen, sports clubs, and social events.
Q8: How functional, comfortable and impressive is your workplace?
(no label) 10.It's classier than a chaise longue designed
by Corbusier.

Q9: How good is the coffee?
(no label) 7
Further comments:
The filter stuff is good.
Q10: How do you rate your firm's canteen?
(no label) 8

Good fresh food. Dinner isn't as good but lunch is definitely a restaurant meal at a third of the price.
Q11: What is the social life like at your firm?
(no label) 8
Further information:
Good mix - depends on department. At a minimum 2/3 department events per year and 3/4 office-wide ones.

effective.
Q12: When do you typically arrive in the office? 8.00
Q13: And when do you typically leave? 5.30
Q14: How long is your commute? 20 minute

admire?
Hard to say - maybe Herbert Smith/Eversheds but I
understand the culture is different.

Q1: How would you rate the quality of your training?
(no label) 10.What training!!!
Further comments:
The firm are committed to your development at a junior level. There are opportunities to do masters degrees and
solicitor advocate courses, at the firm's cost!
Q2: How stimulating is the work you are given?
(no label) 9
Further comments:
Generally, you are given a lot of responsibility early on. There are tedious tasks but they occur at every level.
Q3: How supportive are your peers?
(no label) 6
Further comments:
They are nice but a bit cliquey. If you haven't trained there, it can take a year or so to really feel included. That said, I
am always invited to the pub after work.
Q4: How approachable are your superiors?
(no label) 9
Further comments:
The Partners are very approachable. They are committed to developing you as a junior lawyer and future Partner of
the firm.
Q5: How is your work/life balance?
(no label) 5
Further comments:
The billable target is about 6.5 hours per day which is very reasonable. Nobody bothers me when I am on holiday
and so far I have not had to work at the weekend. Friday nights and weekends are sacrosanct except in very very
very extreme circumstances! Even if you do have to work late, the Partners are always grateful and thank you for
your hard work.
Q6: Have you done an international secondment or
travelled abroad with the firm?
Yes,
If so, where did you go and for how long?
I have been to Madrid twice on business trips. I also
hope to go to the firm's Paris office on secondment
and do a client secondment at some point.

Q7: How good are yourlaw firm'sperks?
(no label) 7
Please provide details of exceptional perks your law firm
offers:
The only thing missing is a gym or subsidised gym membership. Other than that, we have a subsidised restaurant
serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. We have a subsidised Costa coffee branch. There is a multi function room in
which there are yoga and pilates classes during the day. Beauty therapists and massage therapists also use that
room.
Q8: How functional, comfortable and impressive is your workplace?
(no label) 7
Furthercomments:
The modern art on the ground floor is a bit weird. The current one looks like there has been a car crash which nobody
has bothered to clear up. The one before looked like Hannibal Lector started to read 50 shades of grey.... That said,
the views from the client floors are amazing.
Q9: How good is the coffee?
(no label) 8
Further comments:
We have our own costa coffee bar in the restaurant.
Q10: How do you rate your firm's canteen?

Q11: What is the social life like at your firm?

sociable.
