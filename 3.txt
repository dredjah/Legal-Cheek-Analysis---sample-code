Q1: How would you rate the quality of your training?
(no label) 6
Further comments:
My first seat was excellent but my international secondment has left a lot to be desired. It was very structured in
London (Real Estate), and run by some superb and highly experienced lawyers who, for the most part, were also
excellent teachers. Day to day I was often invited to listen in on calls 'as a teaching point', or my supervisor would set
aside time to go through a task in detail with me. There was no such thing as a 'silly question' and there was always
someone who was happy to help. There is limited formal training on secondment due to the size of the office, but
what there has been has been high quality. I have not been given the opportunity to dial in to London training
sessions, which I feel would have been beneficial. Day to day however, I don't feel like I am learning a great deal as
things are not explained to me, too much knowledge is assumed and when I ask questions I often feel as though I
shouldn't have bothered, because I should have known the answer already.
Q2: How stimulating is the work you are given?
(no label) 7
Further comments:
Again, I was really pushed and challenged in my first seat and given the opportunity to take ownership of a number of
engaging tasks, but on secondment it has been more of a mixed bag. Tasks will flip between endless proofreading
peppered with the occasional substantive drafting task. More often than not, I am not even given work to actually do
despite asking.
Q3: How supportive are your peers?
(no label) 8
Further comments:
My intake are really friendly and I had a brilliant time in London working alongside them. I am the only trainee on
secondment in this international office however, and that has impacted heavily on my experience as I simply do not
have peers training in English law who I can ask questions here.
Q4: How approachable are your superiors?
(no label) 6
Further comments:
Generally, across both departments I have sat in, everyone is very friendly and approachable with the exception of
the odd bad egg.

Q5: How is your work/life balance?
(no label) 7
Further comments:
I've actually had very good hours, averaging a 7pm leave roughly. In my second seat, this has been largely due to a
lack of work however. Moreover, frustratingly, work often only lands on my desk mid-afternoon (where I am on
secondment) and this has resulted in a work heavy evening but nothing to do all day. When the department gets
busy, the hours can be horrendous.
Q6: Have you done an international secondment or
travelled abroad with the firm?
Yes,
If so, where did you go and for how long?
Moscow, for 6 months. Great city, culture, language
and people, but disappointing professional
experience.
Q7: How good are yourlaw firm'sperks?
(no label) 7
Please provide details of exceptional perks your law firm
offers:
Gym subsidy, medical insurance, private GP, good on site catering facilities. Excellent secondment benefits, including
free lunch, flat, language lessons and gym.
Q8: How functional, comfortable and impressive is your workplace?
(no label) 6
Furthercomments:
Smaller offices in London, but very spacious in Moscow. The London offices are very down to earth and a bit quirkier
than your average shiny city office building (e.g. there's a lot of random artwork that doesn't follow any particular
scheme of decoration, which is actually really fun to look at). The offices have a bit of personality. The facilities are
really good; we have a coffee shop, canteen and sandwich bar on site.
Q9: How good is the coffee?
(no label) 8
Further comments:
Horrible in the kitchens in London and on that alone I would give a 3; however extra points are given because (a) we
have a Benugos and (b) on secondment we have unlimited Nespresso!
Q10: How do you rate your firm's canteen?
(no label) 7
Further comments:
Great in London - lots of choice and a really good salad bar. In Moscow, you get what you pay for (lunch is free)!
Q11: What is the social life like at your firm?
(no label) 7
Further information:
Regular social activities across both seats. Disappointing that the trainee ball is not an annual event, and we won't
get to go to this until we are about to qualify!
Q12: When do you typically arrive in the office? In London, 9 - 9.30; in Moscow 10am.
