Q1: How would you rate the quality of your training?
(no label) 10.What training!!!
Further comments:
Before the start of each seat, if you're going into a new department, then you attend a specific trainee induction over
the course of one or two days. This is so useful and provides essential training to help you hit the ground running
once you're in the team. Supervision and training does vary between departments, but overall I have been really
impressed.
Q2: How stimulating is the work you are given?
(no label) 9
Further comments:
Understandably, the work does vary but throughout the course of my training contract I have always felt stimulated
by the work I have been given. You are given a good amount of responsibility and I have never been treated as a
photocopying assistant.
